About me

I'm pajama (Jaden Medina). I am a fulltime highschool student currently going into my freshman year studying Electronics, and Computer Science turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.

I have come to realized that tall damands can only be fulfilled by capeable people. Much too often do you think of what those thoughts can be rather than trying to see what you can make them. Today expectation are only rising, which is why ive put it amongst my self to try and meet those demands. Within trying to meet those demands I have started to take place knowing HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Much more. I learned these because it takes one persons creativity to another exetent.
